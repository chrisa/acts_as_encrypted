TODO for acts_as_encrypted
==========================

 * Performance

    * We encrypt and decrypt too much, based on the callbacks set up
      on ActiveRecord. Maybe make encryption / decryption a manual
      process rather than always doing it?

    * Make auto-decrypt / encrypt configurable per column?

 * KeyTool

    * Pretty up output.

 * Tests

    * keystore_test.rb should be testing get_current_key better -- 
      the test missed the sort order being backwards.

    * ... 
 
 * Documentation

    * Document configuration hash (keys, server location, keystore
      path)

    * Extend quickstart in README to include getting it running on an
      ActiveRecord model.

    * Document keytool

    * Document acts_as_encrypted and encrypts macros for AR model
      classes.
